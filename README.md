# StudioDB

A catalog and item tracker I am making for my father in React Native. The user will be able to view all the items in their collection and various information about the item and their collection as a whole.

In the version to come the user will be able to scan a barcode and have it's information auto populated into pre-set fields where they can then store them in their collection.
